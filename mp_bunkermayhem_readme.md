## DESCRIPTION

Bunker Mayhem is one of my very old COD maps, which I converted from 
COD to COD UO and now to COD4. This new revision has been changed
slightly with the addition of a back area for safe spawning for DM, TDM
I have also given it a slight face lift in some areas that I felt 
needed it.

This is a VERY TIGHT map with LOTS of objects to hide behind, this map 
is design for 6 to 8 players MAX due to it's size.

## SUPPORTED GAMETYPES

This map supports DM & TDM (6 to 8 Players MAX)

However below I have included the XYZ coordinates, for CTF flag 
placement. CTF should work with AWE and future versions of Extreme+.

Allies Flag: x217.0 y1504.0 z373.0  
Axis Flag: x224.5 y-868.5 z373.0

## SPECIAL THANKS

To all of the fans that requested this map, I am shocked yet
pleased to see that people liked this map enough to request it 
for COD 4. I hope you all enjoy it.

## DISCLAIMER

I take no responsibility for what this map may do to your 
system or servers, use at you're own risk. LOL Gotta cover my ass, 
even though we all know maps can't hurt your system. Happy fragging ;)
