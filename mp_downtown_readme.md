## Description:


Down Town was basically created by just starting with one building and running with the rest to fit around it.
My goal was to make a medium size map that would allow the run n' gun player, to the one who likes to sit back
and snipe, have a fun time. This map has alot of cover and alot of vantage points.  There is also a sewer 
system that takes you from one side of the map to other.  This can either be seen as a shortcut or as a 
death trap. Be sure to utilize the machine guns in covering certain vantage points.  Hope you like the map, 
as this is my first, and I have another one in the works.  



## Installation Instructions: (C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare)

1. Unzip the included mp_downtown.zip file

2. Place the Map Folder with it's FF files into your 'root/usermaps' folder

3. Place the IWD File in you 'Mods' folder

(You may want to place the IWD File in your 'root/usermaps' folder as well)


Hope you guys enjoy the map, It is my first map and I put alot of time into it.  
Just wanted to make a fun map for all of us to enjoy.  I learned alot making 
this map and want to thank everyone over at the ModsOnline.com and InfinityWard.com
