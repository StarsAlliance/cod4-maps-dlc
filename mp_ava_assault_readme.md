## DESCRIPTION

Aggravated Assault is my first map for cod4. It uses part of the swamp from 
the level 'blackout' that came with the mod tools. The rest is all custom. 
There are two tunnels that lead to the underground bunker and are intended
to be bottleneck points. Also note that you will not spawn in a tunnel either. 
If you belong to a squad that likes to utilize tactics as a team,
then I would suggest packing your loadouts with smoke. It might be neccasary to 
advance in our out of the tunnels.

This map plays well with or without night vision. It has a early morning feels to it. 
I wish I was able to learn how to utilize sound for this map as it would have really brought it to life, But no luck
finding a suitable tutorial.
